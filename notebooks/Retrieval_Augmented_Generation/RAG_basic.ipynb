    "\n",
    "This dataset was downloaded from the [Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction repository](https://github.com/futianfan/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction). The data is derived from clinical trials records on [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), as of February 20, 2021. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provides comprehensive information about various clinical trials. Column information include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NCT ID:** Unique identifiers assigned to each clinical study.\n",
    "- **Status:** The current status of the trial (e.g., completed, not yet recruiting, active, recruiting, suspended, terminated, unknown status, withdrawn).\n",
    "- **Why Stop:** Reasons why the trial was stopped (if applicable). This field can be empty.\n",
    "- **Label:** Binary outcome label indicating the success (1) or failure (0) of the trial.\n",
    "- **Phase:** The phase of the trial (e.g., Phase I, Phase II, Phase III).\n",
    "- **Diseases:** List of disease names associated with the trial.\n",
    "- **ICD Codes:** List of ICD-10 codes corresponding to the diseases.\n",
    "- **Drugs:** List of drug names used in the trial.\n",
    "- **SMILES:** List of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations of the drugs.\n",
    "- **Criteria:** Eligibility criteria for participants in the trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column Description\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed descriptions of each column, please refer to the [column description documentation](https://github.com/futianfan/clinical-trial-outcome-prediction/blob/main/data/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is valuable for analyzing and predicting clinical trial outcomes, exploring the relationships between diseases and treatments, and understanding eligibility criteria and trial phases. It can serve as a starting point for various data-driven applications and research in clinical trials."
