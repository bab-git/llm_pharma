Poor medical risk because of other conditions such as uncontrolled systemic diseases,\\r\\n             active uncontrolled infections, or comorbidities that may put the patient at risk of\\r\\n             not being able to complete at least 2 cycles of treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n          7. Known significant mental illness or other condition, such as active alcohol or other\\r\\n             substance abuse or addiction, that in the opinion of the investigator predisposes the\\r\\n             subject to high risk of noncompliance with the protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n          8. Rapidly progressive or highly proliferative disease (total white blood cell count of\\r\\n             >15 Ã— 10^9/L) or other criteria that render the subject at high risk of requiring\\r\\n             intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy within the next 3 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n          9.

Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin\\r\\n             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, prostate cancer or breast cancer under control with\\r\\n             hormone therapy, or other cancer from which the subject has been disease free for at\\r\\n             least 2 years.\\r\\n      \", metadata={'disease_category': 'leukemia', 'diseases': \"['myelodysplastic syndromes', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia']\", 'drugs': \"['astx727', 'dacogen']\", 'nctid': 'NCT03306264', 'status': 'recruiting'})]"
