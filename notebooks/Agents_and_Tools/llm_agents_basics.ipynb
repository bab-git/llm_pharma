    "Large Language Model (LLM) agents can expand the capabilities of LLMs beyond single call completions. They are crucial for creating dynamic, interactive, and context-aware applications.   \n",
    "In this notebook, we build the following agents:\n",
    "- An LLM agent that calls a single python interpreter tool.\n",
    "- A ReAct based LLM agent that uses two built-in tools, a calculator and a wikipedia search.\n",
    "- User defined agent and its tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build an LLM agent that works based on the [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/) prompting (Action + Observation + Thought).   \n",
    "The Agent uses two built-in tools. One is a calculator API and the other is a wikipedia search agent. The agent decides which tool to use based on the input question (prompt).\n",
